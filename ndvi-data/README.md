NDVI data for the BodemHack region 'De Marke'
---------------------------------------------

A timeseries of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, derived from available Sentinel 2 images for 2017 and 2018 (upto May 2018). Clouds have been removed and replaced with no-data values. All images are singleband, every pixel representing a 10m x 10m surface area. Pixel values range from 1 - 250. Zero (0) is used as no-data value. A grey (0) - blue - brown - lichtgreen - darkgreen colour table is added to each image.

The actual NDVI value can be calculated from the pixel value by: ndvi = pixel_value / 250.

An RGB image of the area is also available in the folder as a reference.
